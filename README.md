# Business-Card
An iOS app built using SwiftUI that displays our contact info. I built this app to learn about SwiftUI. This app involves:
1. Arranging elements to create complex layouts.
2. Extracting subviews to create reusable SwiftUI components.
3. Adding custom fonts to project.
4. Using SF symbols.
